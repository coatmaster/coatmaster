# Hello World App

This is a minimal "Hello World" application for the Coatmaster Flex, serving as the simplest possible example of a custom QML app.

## Functionality

-   **Displays Text:** The app simply shows the text "Hello World" centered on the screen.
-   **Closes on Back Button:** It includes the essential `Connections` to `FlexDialog` to allow the user to close the application using the device's hardware back button.

## Purpose

This app is primarily intended as:

-   A basic template for new Coatmaster Flex QML applications.
-   A quick test to verify that QML applications can be successfully deployed and run on the device.
-   A demonstration of the absolute minimum code required for a functional Flex QML app.

## Files

-   `App.qml`: The single QML file containing all the application's logic and UI.
